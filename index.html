				<b>welcome!</b><br/>Super Cyclonic Storm Amphan was a powerful and deadly tropical cyclone that caused widespread damage in Eastern India and Bangladesh in May 2020. It was the strongest tropical cyclone to strike the Ganges Delta since Sidr of the 2007 season and the first super cyclonic storm to occur in the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 Odisha cyclone.[1][2] Causing over US$13 billion of damage, Amphan is also the costliest cyclone ever recorded in the North Indian Ocean, surpassing the record held by Cyclone Nargis of 2008.[3]
The first tropical cyclone of the 2020 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Amphan originated from a low-pressure
				area persisting a couple hundred miles (300 km) east of Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 13 May 2020. Tracking
				northeastward, the disturbance organized over exceptionally warm sea surface temperatures; the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) upgraded the system to a tropical depression on 15 May while the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) followed suit the following day. On 17 May, Amphan underwent rapid intensification and became an extremely severe cyclonic storm within 12 hours.
On 18 May, at approximately 12:00 UTC, Amphan reached its peak intensity with 3-minute sustained wind speeds of 240 km/h (150 mph), 
				1-minute sustained wind speeds of 260 km/h (160 mph), and a minimum central barometric pressure of 925 mbar (27.32 inHg). The storm began an eyewall replacement cycle shortly after it reached its peak intensity, but the continued effects of dry air and wind shear disrupted this process and caused Amphan to gradually weaken as it paralleled the eastern coastline of India. On 20 May, between 10:00 and 11:00 UTC, the cyclone made landfall in West Bengal. At the time, the JTWC estimated Amphan's 1-minute sustained winds to be 155 km/h (100 mph). Amphan rapidly weakened once inland and dissipated shortly thereafter.
Coastal areas in Odisha—as well as Kolkata, Hooghly, Howrah, East Midnapur, North 24 Parganas, and South 24 Parganas
				in West Bengal—were affected by the cyclone. It also caused significant destruction in Bangladesh.[4]

During 13 May 2020, an area of low pressure developed over the Southeastern Bay of Bengal about 1020 km (635 mi) to 
	the southeast of Visakhapatnam in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.[5][6] The area of low pressure was located 
	within a favorable environment for further development with good equator-ward outflow, warm sea surface temperatures, 
	and low vertical wind shear.[6] Over the next couple of days, the system became more marked as it gradually consolidated
	further, with bands of deep atmospheric convection wrapping into the system's low-level center.[7][8] During 16 May, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported that the area of low pressure had developed into a depression and designated it as BOB 01 while it was located about 1,100 km (685 mi) to the south of Paradip in the Indian state of Odisha.[9]
Moving northwards, the depression continually organised and became a cyclonic storm a few hours later, receiving the name Amphan.
	Intensification was temporarily impeded as moderate easterly wind shear disrupted the system's cloud pattern.[10] On 17 May,
	conditions for significant intensification became more conducive as upper-level winds improved. As a result, Amphan underwent
	rapid intensification into a severe cyclonic storm, with the JTWC assessing an increase in winds from 140 km/h (85 mph) at 12:00 UTC to 215 km/h (130 mph), the equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, just six hours later.[11] Furthermore, the IMD upgraded Amphan to an extremely severe cyclonic storm on their cyclone intensity scale.[12] The broad storm was characterized by a cloud shield extending more than 1,110 km (690 mi) and a sharply-outlined 10 nautical mile-wide eye.[13]
Early on 18 May, microwave imagery depicted two distinct concentric eyewalls, a telltale sign of an eyewall replacement cycle that
	is typical for very intense cyclones.[14] Through the day, the effects of wind shear and dry air hampered this internal core change, instead causing the eyewall to erode by late on 18 May.[15] Around 5:30 p.m. IST (12:00 UTC), Amphan made landfall near Bakkhali, West Bengal with winds of 155 km/h (100 mph).[16] As it moved further inland, it rapidly weakened. Just six hours after landfall, the JTWC downgraded it to a Category 1-equivalent cyclone and issued its final warning on the system as it became disorganized.[17]
[18] Roxy Mathew Koll, a scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and lead author of IPCC Oceans and Cryosphere, said: "Our research shows that high ocean temperatures are conducive for rapid intensification of cyclones in the north Indian Ocean. In the current case, the Bay of Bengal has been particularly warm. Some of the buoys in the Bay of Bengal registered maximum surface temperatures of 32-34 degrees Celsius consecutively for the first two weeks of May. These are record temperatures driven by climate change — we have never seen such high values until now."

	Amphan's forecast track placed 38.9 million people in India and Bangladesh at risk of exposure to the storm's winds,
	according to the US Pacific Disaster Center.[19] The formation of the precursor low-pressure system prompted the IMD
	to issue a cyclonic alert for India's coastline along the Bay of Bengal, advising fishermen not to sail to susceptible
	locations in the Bay of Bengal from 15–18 May.[20] Fishermen from Sri Lanka were also advised by the national government to
	return to or remain in the country,[21] and additional maritime traffic from Singapore and other countries were advised to
	remain clear of Amphan's vicinity.[22] Ships and aircraft of the Indian Coast Guard directed fishing boats to harbour in 
	coordination with the administrations and fisheries departments of Odisha and West Bengal.[23] The Maritime Rescue Coordination
	Centre in Chennai activated an International Safety Net for the Bay of Bengal.[22] Ports were cleared and their operations
	suspended along the Bay of Bengal, while ferry service along major routes in Bangladesh was suspended by the Bangladesh Inland
	Water Transport Corporation.[24][25] Bangladeshi ports suspended the loading and unloading of goods onboard ships.[26] Smaller vessels in the harbour at Chittagong were moved to safety upstream the Karnaphuli River.[27] Ships were ordered out of some ports, such as the port of Paradip, to avoid damage.[28] Public works departments were called upon by the government of Odisha to ensure infrastructure resiliency;[29] crews and backup systems for electricity and telecommunications were deployed to meet these needs,[30] establishing helplines for emergency response.[31] Rail and vehicular traffic in Odisha and West Bengal was halted or rerouted.[32] The Shramik train service for migrant workers was halted in both states for up to four days, with service expected to be curtailed in the storm's aftermath.[33][34][35][36] Other migrants travelling to Odisha were asked to wait out the storm.[37] AC Express special trains operating routes between New Delhi and Bhubaneswar were diverted to avoid the cyclone's effects.[38] Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport in Kolkata was closed until 21 May, with planes evacuating or chocked and the airport terminal roof fortified to minimize damage.[39][40]
Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting with Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah, Chief Minister of West Bengal Mamata Banerjee,
	Chief Minister of Odisha Naveen Patnaik and other officials on 18 May to review preparations and evacuation plans.[41][42] Teams from the Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) were pre-positioned across districts in Odisha and West Bengal on 17 May to assist in preparations for Amphan and render aid where necessary,[29][43][44] with additional units placed on standby;[45] these units could be readily airlifted to affected areas onboard Indian Air Force transport aircraft.[46] The National Disaster Management Authority advised that these crews and other first responders would also need personal protective equipment and N95 masks due to the ongoing pandemic.[47] A diving team from the Indian Navy was sent to Kolkata to aid relief efforts,[48] with ships from the navy placed on standby for relief operations.[49]
The Bangladesh Cyclone Preparedness Programme and National Disaster Response Coordination Group convened on 18 May to outline
	preparations for Amphan.[50] Several non-governmental agencies coordinated with the Cyclone Preparedness Programme to 
	support Rohingya refugees at camps in Cox's Bazar during Amphan.[51] The Department of Public Health Engineering distributed
	sanitation supplies and set up 15 water treatment plants.[52] All 32 Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar were staffed with relief
	volunteers.[53] Health services in Bangladesh during the storm were reinforced by 1,933 medical teams distributed around Bangladesh.[54] Fifteen thousand volunteers and 284 medical teams were prepared to render aid around Chittagong.[27] According to Inter-Services Public Relations, 145 disaster management teams from the Bangladesh Armed Forces were placed on standby with special equipment. The Bangladesh Army deployed 71 medical teams and arranged 18,400 packets and relief materials in preparation for Amphan's aftermath. Twenty-five ships were dispatched by the Bangladesh Navy to handle emergency, rescue, and relief operations, with aerial support from the Bangladesh Air Force.[55] The Ministry of Agriculture of Bangladesh advised coastal farmers to harvest all mature paddy fields to mitigate the estimated loss of 12 percent of crop yield.[56] Seven thousand domestic animals were also moved to shelter under the direction of the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock.[57]
